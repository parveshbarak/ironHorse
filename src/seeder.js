Ipamorelin acts synergistically when applied during a Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH) pulse or when it is administered along with a GHRH or an analog such as Sermorelin or Modified GRF 1-29 (growth releasing factor, aminos 1-29). The synergy comes both due to the suppression of somatostatin and the fact that ipamorelin increases GH release per-somatotrope, while GHRH increases the number of somatotropes releasing GH. On the other hand, Ipamorelin is similar to GHRP-6 because they both release GH at a very similar strength minus the side effects that of GHRP-6. Both GHRP-6 and GHRP-2 cause a release and an increase in cortisol and prolactin levels, however Ipamorelin only selectively releases GH at any dose. Ipamorelin shares similar functionality to Hexarelin and compared to other peptides, it is a much more stable form of ghrelin and has longer half-life periods of at least two hours long and causes secondary effect by making neurons to become excited.',
